# JavaCollections

This repository is a collection of different data structures implemented in java to understand the internal mechanisms of different data structures like arrays, maps and others.
The data structures are created without the standard java collection classes, so that the internal working mechanisms and their  implementations are understood better. 
This implementation can be used as an example to implement equivalent Data structures in other programming language.
